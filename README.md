Parking Space Detection and Booking Using Ultrasonic Sensor
Developed a web application that detects the availability of parking spaces using ultrasonic sensor. The sensor at each parking spot continuously detects the presence of vehicle and determines the availability. 
The ultrasonic sensor is connected to Arduino Uno board to get the readings. 
Used Java to program Arduino chip which reads the data sensed by sensor. This data is filtered and processed using Processing 3.0 and inserted into the database. 
MySQL is used to access the database and PHP in the backend. 
Integrated with Google maps API to display the nearby parking lots. 
Front-end deeveloped using bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Ajax to update the parking map efficiently.

Technologies Used: <b>Java, Php, MySQL, bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Google maps API, Processing 3.0, Arduino IDE.</b>
